This package / module is an unofficial python package because it provides malicious services like multi-client server connections, and snippet execution to clients that are connected to the server.

Features:
    GUI + OVERLAY_GUI (we have gui templates that allow you to create apps easily but if you really want to configure your window all the way you can use our overlay api basically its a overlay that python draws and you can make your own window like application)
    RAC (REMOTE-API-CALLING) basically, oxyum services allows you to call python modules without actually having to install them into your python environment.
